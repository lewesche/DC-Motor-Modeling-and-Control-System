# DC-Motor-Modeling-and-Control-System

Final Lab report for Sensors, Actuators, and Control System Design course. Describes the process of developing plant model of DC motor system based on mechanical and electrical equations of motion, simulating open and closed loop control inputs and disturbance interaction, and implementing and analyzing various control algorithms. Uses Matlab, Simulink, and Arduino hardware and software. 

See included PDF for full documentation and results. All Simulink models, Matlab scripts, and data collected are available upon request, with the exception of a handfull of Simulink models that were provided by the University of Washington.
